The basic monitor just clones the whole object as we discussed

I do not really know how to implement Wait, Notify, and NotifyAll
They could probably be implemented using conditions of the reentrant lock
but I dont know how reverting the object gets handled in this context.

The class currently compiles, but I have not tested for functionallity

Currently, all the references to Object could just be replaced with generics
but this would not be extendable to the partitioned implementation of this lock
(where there is a list of objects as opposed to just one)

I am basically just using the reentrant lock as a semaphore

all the functions that have "if(Thread.currentThread().equals(owner))" should 
probably throw an illegal monitor state exception. I am just leaving it out
because, for testing, dont want to have to make a bunch of try-catch blocks
